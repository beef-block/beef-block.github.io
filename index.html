              Current labelling practices share product

              <br> such as:
              <br>• Product description

            QR codes located on product packaging give the consumer
            access to the information stored on the Blockchain through an

                BeefBlock is a dedicated platform committed to ensuring that consumers have
              access to the highest quality beef by leveraging the power of blockchain
              technology for food traceability.
              BeefBlock's key feature is a user-friendly platform that allows consumers to
              verify the quality of the beef they purchase. By simply scanning a QR code
              printed on the beef product, consumers can access a wealth of information
              about the beef they are considering. This QR code is a gateway to a
              comprehensive database that encompasses data recorded at every critical stage,
              starting from the farm and continuing all the way to the point of sale which
              includes the beef's origin, the farm it came from, its processing and handling,
              safety measures adhered to, and even feedback from previous buyers. This
              access to detailed information allows consumers to make informed decisions,
              instilling a sense of confidence and trust in the product’s quality, safety, and
              dependability.

                BeefBlock is a platform that uses blockchain technology to track the food
                traceability of beef. The physical flow layer is designed for the physical food
                supply chain, tracing food goods from producer to consumer. The second flow
                layer is a digital record system where data from the physical flow layer is
                recorded simultaneously with other digital technologies, such as RFID, QR codes,
                and other sensors. The third flow layer is a digital blockchain infrastructure
                network where, using a smart contract, the information recorded in the second
                flow layer is confirmed by all participating bodies/parties using a consensus
                method, creating a virtual data block at every point in the supply chain. This flow
                layer, comprising a chain of digital data blocks, follows the physical flow layer. It
                is an immutable record-keeping platform, as attempting to hack or alter
                information changes the hash value of that specific block and prevents the
                changed value from entering the blockchain.
